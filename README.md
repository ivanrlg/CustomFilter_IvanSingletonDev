# CustomTokeFilterBC

Custom Filter Tokens is an interesting feature in Business Central, which allows us to add filter tokens in the form:

TOMORROW
YESTERDAY
THISMONTH
THISYEAR
FISCALYEAR
CHRISTMAS
In other words, Tokens are special words that resolve to one or more values, saving the user time without manually manipulating dates or navigating to other pages to find values to enter as filter criteria.
